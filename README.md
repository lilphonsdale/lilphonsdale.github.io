# belly-button-challenge

#Description

This dashboard allows the user to investigate the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, as it is found at https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

By selecting a sample ID from the drop down menu, the user will see updated charts that show that sample's top 10 OTUs (microbial species) and the number of bacteria cultures in the sample. 

The script is found in app.js. It uses the d3 library to create the charts and make the page interactive.

#Acknowledgements and Thanks

This assignment felt impossible for a while. I got great help from my classmates and TAs. I also consulted the following examples and used individual lines of their code in my script:
